RSpec Outline
-----------

# 2 Questions
 - How much do you know about RSpec?
 - What do you hate about testing?

# What It Tries To accomplish
 - BDD-esque framework (emphasis on "framework")
  - Descriptive (tries to tell a story)
 - Iterative development (baby steps)

# Best Practices
 - `context`
  - What (it is) and when (it should be used)
 - `let`
  - What and benefit (vs. instance variables)
 - Factories
  - Why the community favors them over fixtures
  - FactoryGirl
   - Example
 - Test doubles
  - Mocks vs. stubs (maybe fakes and dummy too?)
  - When to mock
   - Example
  - When to stub
   - Example
 - `guard`
  - Why?
 - `should` vs. `expect`
  - Why `expect` is preferred

# The case for RSpec
 - Semantics
  - Naturally more DRY?
  - Readability
  - `pending`

# The case against RSpec
 - Complexity
  - Readability
  - Alternatives are simpler and more familiar
 - Forced organization
