-----------

# 2 Questions:
 - How much do you know about RSpec?
 - What do you hate about testing?

# What It Tries To accomplish:
 - BDD-esque framework (emphasis on "framework")
  - Descriptive (tries to tell a story)
 - Iterative development (baby steps)

# Best Practices:
 - `context`
  - What (it is) and when (it should be used)
 - `let`
  - What and benefit (vs. instance variables)
